Created a school database search using C++ and implemented a custom hash map.

to run code:
g++ main.cpp
.a/.out
*enter the information provided line by line in the input.txt's*
example:
John Smith 1234567 (press enter)
y

alternate way to run code:
g++ main.cpp
.a/.out < input01.txt (swap with any input.txt file name)

*this will fun the txt file for you and give you the direct output*
